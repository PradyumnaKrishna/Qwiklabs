2002 IN REVIEW: NOT PERFECT, BUT IT SURE BEAT 2001

    Welcome to my 2002 Year in Review column, which
         I feel very safe in asserting you are reading
         here first. It's been a pretty good year, unless
         of course you hate Microsoft, love Linux,
         or were hoping HP and Compaq would unite. Read
         on for my highlights of the year that's about
         to happen.

    MS STALLING?... MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...

    Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine
    states still pursing the software giant's
    antitrust case sure think so. They've
    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's
    request to delay the remedy hearings,
    though Microsoft says any holdup is
    the states' fault for seeking such a
    tough remedy.
