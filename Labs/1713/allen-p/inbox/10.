HOPE AHEAD: WHAT I LEARNED FROM 2001'S TRAGEDIES

    As years go, 2001 sucked. But adversity teaches
         us more important lessons than prosperity.
         So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002
         will prove to be very educational--and in
         ways that matter. Here's what I learned this
         year, as I saw technology--and the world--change
         for good.

    P2P: NOW FOR BIZ... WHAT'S HP'S FATE?... OS X GAINS
CONVERTS...

    Peer-to-peer isn't just for Napster
    anymore. The technology is taking hold
    in businesses, universities, and the
    armed forces. It's being used to find
    a cure for cancer and to facilitate battlefield
    communication. Is there anything P2P
    can't do?

         do, you might think twice. Wayne Rash offers
         a cautionary tale.
